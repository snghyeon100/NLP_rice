## 📄 Abstract

As multilingual large language models become more widely used, ensuring their safety and fairness across diverse linguistic contexts presents unique challenges. While existing research on machine unlearning has mainly focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we address the problem of multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes into ten languages through translation—English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian—spanning five language families and varying resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages tends to be more stable, with asymmetric transfer observed between typologically related languages. Moreover, analysis of linguistic distances reveals that syntactic similarity is the most predictive factor of cross-lingual unlearning effects.

## 🧠 Background: TOFU Benchmark

This work builds upon **TOFU: Task of Fictitious Unlearning**, a benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning performance of large language models on realistic question–answering tasks. TOFU consists of QA pairs derived from synthetically generated autobiographies of fictitious authors, enabling controlled evaluation of forgetting and retention.

## 🌍 Multilingual Extension

We extend TOFU to **10 languages**:

- English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian  
- Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, Indonesian  

📁 **All datasets for all languages are provided directly in the `dataset/` folder.**

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Finetuning

First, fine-tune the model on the **full dataset**:

```bash
python finetune.py
```

You can modify training hyperparameters, model selection, and data paths in:
```
config/finetune.yaml
```

---

### 2️⃣ Unlearning 

To forget a specific dataset or language subset, run:

```bash
python forget.py
```

You can specify **which dataset or language to forget** by editing:
```
config/forget.yaml
```

---

### 3️⃣ Evaluation

To evaluate the unlearned models, run:

```bash
python evaluate_util.py
```

Evaluation settings, including **per-language evaluation**, can be configured in:
```
config/eval_everything.yaml
```

---

### 4️⃣ Aggregating Evaluation Results

To aggregate evaluation results and compute overall **model utility** and **forget quality**, run:

```bash
python aggregate_eval_stat.py
```

You can specify:
- the **retain model evaluation path**
- the **unlearned model evaluation path**

by editing:
```
config/aggregate_eval_stat.yaml
```
